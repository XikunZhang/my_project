# Template Experiment - Naturalness

### Things for me to do before the tutorial
1. Change instructions and add good comments to js
2. Make a simplified version and write more detailed questions to lead to this version 
3. when using conditional stimuli (exp.conditionalStims) save item and condition (log_responses)
3. Go over definitions of class, object, array

-----------------------------------------------------------

### TO DO:
1. How do we add more stimuli?
2. How do we add conditions and change stimuli according to that?
3. How do we save results?

#### EXTRA:
1. Add example trials
